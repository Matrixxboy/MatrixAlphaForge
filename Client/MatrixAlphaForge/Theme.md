## 🚀 Better Component Architecture

For a professional fintech UI, you should organize your `components/` using the **Atomic Design** philosophy:

1. **Atoms:** `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Spinner`, `Typography`.
2. **Molecules:** `SearchField`, `StatCard`, `TablePagination`, `AlertItem`.
3. **Organisms:** `NavigationSidebar`, `DataGrid`, `ChartContainer`, `TransactionHistory`.
